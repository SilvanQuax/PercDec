# Reinforcement learning of perceptual decision making

## Introducion
This repository contains the code and data to reproduce the findings from our paper.

test_dynamic_task4.py is the wrapper to train a reinforcement learning agent.  
test_dynamic_task_sup is the wrapper to train a supervised agent.  
Load_task4_final generates all reinfrocement learning figures from the paper.  
Load_supervised_final generates all supervised figures from the paper.  

## Requirements
Code is written in Python. Neural networks are based on the Chainer library [1]

Required libraries:
- Chainer v3
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- time
- scikit-learn
